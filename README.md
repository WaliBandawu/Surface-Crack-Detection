# Surface-Crack-Detection

##Overview
This project is a Surface Crack Detection Web Application built using Flask. It leverages a pre-trained deep learning model (dima806/surface_crack_image_detection) from the Hugging Face Transformers library for image classification. Users can upload images to detect surface cracks, and the app provides predictions with annotated images.

##Features
Image Classification: Classifies images to detect surface cracks with confidence scores.
Image Annotation: Annotates uploaded images with the top prediction label and confidence.
Web Interface: Intuitive HTML-based user interface for uploading images and viewing results.
Static Image Storage: Uploaded and annotated images are stored in dedicated folders.
Prerequisites
Python: Install Python 3.8 or higher.
Libraries:
Flask
Transformers
Pillow
Folder Setup:
static/uploads: To store uploaded images.
static/annotated: To store annotated images.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/surface-crack-detection.git
cd surface-crack-detection
Install dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Create necessary folders:

bash

mkdir -p static/uploads static/annotated
How to Run
Start the Flask application:

bash

python app.py
Access the app: Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## File Structure
app.py: Main Flask application code.
templates/index.html: Frontend HTML template for the web interface.
static/uploads/: Stores uploaded images.
static/annotated/: Stores annotated images.
Usage
Navigate to the homepage (/).
Upload an image using the "Choose File" button.
Click the "Upload and Predict" button.
View predictions and annotated images on the same page.
Model Information
Model: dima806/surface_crack_image_detection
Pipeline: Hugging Face's image-classification pipeline.
API Endpoints
/
Method: GET
Description: Renders the home page.
/predict
Method: POST
Description: Accepts an uploaded image, runs predictions, and returns results along with the annotated image URL.
/<path:filename>
Method: GET
Description: Serves static files (uploaded or annotated images).
Example Output
Predictions: Displays labels and confidence scores for cracks.
Annotated Image: Highlights predictions directly on the uploaded image.
Future Enhancements
